# Enabling Eleva AMS
Flip one DNS switch. Eleva does the magic.
Your site stays the same. Eleva just adds the AI superpowers on top.

> **Important: First get written approval from the **Eleva Team** for your domain. Without that approval, the connection won’t work.

<Info>
  **Friendly Reminder**:

  Before pointing your A record to Eleva, save your current A record. If you ever need to roll back, it’s a one-minute fix.
</Info>

## What you’ll do (high-level)

1. Sign in where your domain is managed (GoDaddy, Registro.br, Cloudflare, etc.).
2. Open your **DNS / Zone** settings.
3. Find your existing **A record** for the root of your domain (often shown as `@`).
4. Replace its IP with **`98.89.186.43`** and save.
5. Tell Eleva Team you’ve updated it so we can verify and turn things on.
