# Activate Eleva AMS (non-technical)

A tiny DNS change is all it takes. You’ll point your domain to Eleva so we can add tracking and gentle auto-optimization—**no code changes** and your website stays exactly the same.


<Note>
  **Important:** Do not change DNS until the Eleva Team confirms your domain is enabled. Without our approval, Eleva won’t work on your website.

## Step-by-step

1. Get Eleva’s approval for your domain.
2. Log in where your domain’s **DNS** is managed (GoDaddy, Wix, Namecheap, etc.).
3. Find your **A record** for the root (host **@**).
4. Replace its IP with **`98.89.186.43`** and save.
5. Tell Eleva so we can verify and start baseline tracking.

## Friendly reminders (best practices)

* **Friendly reminder:** Before pointing your A record to Eleva, **save your current A record** (screenshot + copy the IP). If you ever need to roll back, it’s a one-minute fix.
* **Only one per host:** For the same host (`@` or `www`), choose **A or CNAME—never both**.
* **Replace, don’t stack:** **Remove what exists** for that host, then **add ours**. For the default setup, that means **one A record** pointing to **`98.89.186.43`**.
* **Don’t touch email:** Leave **MX** (and **TXT** like SPF/DKIM/DMARC) alone—those control email, not website routing.
* **Low-traffic window:** If possible, make changes during quieter hours.
* **Keep DNS open:** Leave the DNS tab open until Eleva confirms everything looks good.

## What happens next 

* **Days 1-30 — Baseline:** We just measure how bots already interact with your content. No changes to your site content.
* **Days 30-60 — Gentle auto-tuning:** We gradually enable safe optimizations and compare against your baseline.
* **Ongoing — Autopilot:** Continuous improvements as we gather more AI Bot history.

---

## Rollback (if you ever need it)

* Edit the **A record for `@`** back to the IP you saved, then **Save**.
* With TTL at **300s**, propagation often completes in minutes.
* Tell Eleva so we can help diagnose and re-enable when you’re ready.

## `www` handling

* Most providers set **`www`** as a **CNAME** to your root domain. That’s fine—leave it.
* If your **`www`** is an **A** record and you’re unsure, ask Eleva before changing it.
* Remember: **A or CNAME per host, not both**.
