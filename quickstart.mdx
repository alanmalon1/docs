# Activate Eleva AMS (non-technical)

A tiny DNS change is all it takes. You’ll point your domain to Eleva so we can add tracking and gentle auto-optimization—**no code changes** and your website stays exactly the same.

> **Important:** **Do not change DNS until the Eleva Team confirms your domain is enabled.** Without our approval, the connection won’t work.

---

## What you’ll do (at a glance)

1. Get Eleva’s approval for your domain.
2. Log in where your domain’s **DNS** is managed (GoDaddy, Wix, Namecheap, etc.).
3. Find your **A record** for the root (host **@**).
4. Replace its IP with **`98.89.186.43`** and save.
5. Tell Eleva so we can verify and start baseline tracking.

## Step-by-step (zero jargon)

### 1) Get approval from Eleva (required)

* Reply to your onboarding email or message your Eleva contact with your domain (e.g., `example.com`).
* Wait for our **“All set—go ahead”** confirmation.

### 2) Log in to your domain provider

* This is where you bought or manage the domain (GoDaddy, Cloudflare, Namecheap, Squarespace, Wix, etc.).

### 3) Open your DNS / Zone settings

* Look for **DNS**, **Manage DNS**, **Zone Editor**, or **Advanced DNS**.

### 4) Locate the host you’ll point

* For your main site, this is usually the **root host** shown as **`@`** (sometimes the provider displays your full domain name).
* You may also have a **`www`** record. Leave it as is **unless Eleva instructs otherwise**.

### 5) Apply the correct record rule (A *or* CNAME, not both)

For a **given host (e.g., `@` or `www`)**, DNS should have **only one** of these:

* **Either** a single **A** record,
* **Or** a single **CNAME** record.
  You **cannot** have a CNAME for a name that also has other records (A/MX/TXT/etc.).

**For Eleva (default path = A record on `@`):**

* **Remove** any **CNAME** that exists for the same host.
* Keep **only one A record** for that host.
* Set **Value / Points to** = **`98.89.186.43`**.
* **Save**.

> If Eleva specifically instructs you to use **CNAME** for a host, first **remove all A records** for that host, then keep **only one CNAME** (we’ll provide the target).

### 6) (Optional) Set a short TTL

* If you see **TTL**, leaving default is fine.
* For faster propagation or easy rollback, choose **300 seconds (5 minutes)**.

### 7) Tell Eleva it’s done

* Send a quick “done” message (or click **Verify** in your onboarding link, if provided).
* We’ll confirm the connection and start **baseline tracking** for the first 1–2 days (observe only).

## Friendly reminders (best practices)

* **Friendly reminder:** Before pointing your A record to Eleva, **save your current A record** (screenshot + copy the IP). If you ever need to roll back, it’s a one-minute fix.
* **Only one per host:** For the same host (`@` or `www`), choose **A or CNAME—never both**.
* **Replace, don’t stack:** **Remove what exists** for that host, then **add ours**. For the default setup, that means **one A record** pointing to **`98.89.186.43`**.
* **Don’t touch email:** Leave **MX** (and **TXT** like SPF/DKIM/DMARC) alone—those control email, not website routing.
* **Low-traffic window:** If possible, make changes during quieter hours.
* **Keep DNS open:** Leave the DNS tab open until Eleva confirms everything looks good.

## What happens next (calm & predictable)

* **Days 1-30 — Baseline:** We just measure how bots already interact with your content. No changes to your site content.
* **Days 30-60 — Gentle auto-tuning:** We gradually enable safe optimizations and compare against your baseline.
* **Ongoing — Autopilot:** Continuous improvements as we gather more AI Bot history.

---

## Rollback (if you ever need it)

* Edit the **A record for `@`** back to the IP you saved, then **Save**.
* With TTL at **300s**, propagation often completes in minutes.
* Tell Eleva so we can help diagnose and re-enable when you’re ready.

---

## `www` handling (common setups)

* Most providers set **`www`** as a **CNAME** to your root domain. That’s fine—leave it.
* If your **`www`** is an **A** record and you’re unsure, ask Eleva before changing it.
* Remember: **A or CNAME per host, not both**.

## Quick FAQ

**Will this break my email?**
No. Email uses **MX** and related **TXT** records, which you aren’t changing.

**What if my provider forces `proxied`/`orange cloud` (e.g., Cloudflare)?**
Follow Eleva’s instruction—some setups require **DNS-only** (no proxy). We’ll specify which mode.

**I don’t see an A record for `@`. What now?**
Some builders manage DNS behind the scenes. Tell us your provider; we’ll send a 30-second path or a provider-specific guide.

## Compliance note

> **Do not point DNS without Eleva’s explicit approval.**
> If you change DNS before we enable your domain on our side, traffic will not route correctly.
