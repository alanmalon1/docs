# Activate Eleva AMS

A tiny DNS change is all it takes. You’ll point your domain to Eleva so we can add tracking and gentle auto-optimization—**no code changes** and your website stays exactly the same.

<Note>
  **Important:** Do not change DNS until the Eleva Team confirms your domain is enabled. Without our approval, Eleva won’t work on your website.

## Step-by-step

1. Get Eleva’s approval for your domain.
2. Log in where your domain’s **DNS** is managed (GoDaddy, Wix, Namecheap, etc.).
3. Find your **A record** for the root (host **@**).
4. Replace its IP with **`98.89.186.43`** and save.
5. Tell Eleva so we can verify and start baseline tracking.

## Friendly reminders (best practices)

- **Friendly reminder:** Before pointing your A record to Eleva, **save your current A record** (screenshot + copy the IP). If you ever need to roll back, it’s a one-minute fix.
- **Only one per host:** For the same host (`@` or `www`), choose **A or CNAME—never both**.
- **Replace, don’t stack:** **Remove what exists** for that host, then **add ours**. For the default setup, that means **one A record** pointing to **`98.89.186.43`**.
- **Keep DNS open:** Leave the DNS tab open until Eleva confirms everything looks good.

## `www` handling

- Most providers set **`www`** as a **CNAME** to your root domain. That’s fine—leave it.
- If your **`www`** is an **A** record and you’re unsure, ask Eleva before changing it.
- Remember: **A or CNAME per host, not both**.
